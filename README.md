# Python-Projects
A collection of Python projects written inside Jupyter Notebook showcasing entry and intermediate Python skills including data cleaning, analysis, visualization, webscraping, etc. Not all projects are complete but will be updated as I finish cleaning and fixing code!


`What the Fandango`: Double checking a report by Walt Hickey, a data journalist, who found strong evidence that Fandango, a movie website for ticket selling and ratings, was biased and inflated ratings of movies. We check the data out and see if the ratings changed between the report in 2015 to in 2016 when Fandango said they had 'fixed' the issue

`What's the Hold Up?: Traffic Analysis on I-94 Interstate Highway and What Causes It`: An exploration and analysis of traffic data from I-94 figuring out which columns indicated heavy traffic.

`Google Play Store and Apple Store Analysis`: Exploration and analysis of the online app stores from Google and Apple answering some basic questions concerning most popular genres, cleaning of the data, etc. IN PROGRESS

There are more projects in the works and projects being cleaned up so keep an eye out for new ones coming soon!
